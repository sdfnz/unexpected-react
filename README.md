# About

This is a collection of React components that intentionally have behavior that you wouldn't normally expect, e.g. a button that moves away when you click it rather than doing something useful.

# Usage

You'll need both React and ReactDOM in order to use the components, as well as 'hidden'css' in the src/styles directory of this project, which you can either include in your base html page, or import into whichever React component you plan on using these in. 

All of the components are in the src/components directory, and you can copy whichever component you want into your project and use it like any other React component.

Usage of a transpiler like Babel is recommended, but I tried not to use any fancy/special syntax, so it may work without transpiling.
